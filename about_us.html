          <p style="font-size:x-large;">We are a new mathematics interest group with a goal of creating and open and welcoming community of young mathematicians from around the country. 
            Members will have a place to discuss their current projects and classes and make new like-minded life-long friends. </br>
            <br><br>
            In IMIG, members encourage and support all other members to excel in all facets of life, whether academic, career, or socially.
          </p>
          <h2>Academics and Research</h2>
          <p>We believe that academics are one of the most important aspects of attending college, and we put a large emphasis on helping our members meet and exceed their acadmeic goals.

            One of the best ways to enrich one's STEM degree is by applying it through research. While research can be daunting, especially when through tenured professors, its not out of reach. 
            To bring more flexable and open research to more mathematicians and statisticians in America we have created a student research group entitled Student Led Research (SLR). Under the mentorship of a Charles Schwab quantitative analyst,
            SLR looks to give the opportunity to apply the skills learned in college to a real-world projects that can be later used to find future jobs. IMIG members are strongly encouraged to consider applying. 
            <br>More information can be found here: <a href="slrwl.wordpress.com">SLR</a>
          </p>
          <h2>Professionalism</h2>
          <p>Professionalism is also a fundamental aspect of growing your dream career. IMIG looks to help aspiring mathematicians with finding their dream career path and setting themselves up in a way to one day achieve said goals. We plan to host resume critiques, career discussions, and tips on how to begin and expand your career.</p>
